# MyToken Solidity Program

MyToken is a simple Solidity program that illustrates the basic functionality of a token in the Solidity programming language. This program is designed as an educational starting point for individuals new to Solidity who wish to grasp its fundamentals.

## Description

MyToken is a Solidity smart contract created for the Ethereum blockchain. It features two essential functions: "mint" and "burn." The "mint" function adds a specified value to the balance, while the "burn" function subtracts a specified amount from the balance. This program serves as a straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, providing a foundation for more complex projects.

## Getting Started

### Execution

To run this program, you can utilize Remix, an online Solidity Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Follow these steps:

1. Visit the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
2. Create a new file and save it with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).
3. Copy and paste the provided code into the file.

### Compilation

1. Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
2. Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.10" or another compatible version.
3. Click the "Compile MyToken.sol" button to compile the code.

### Deployment

1. Deploy the contract by navigating to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
2. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Deploy" button.

### Interaction

After deploying the contract, you can interact with it by calling the "mint" and "burn" functions. Here's how:

1. Click on the "MyToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar.
2. Select the "mint" function to add a value to the balance.
3. Use the "burn" function to deduct a specific value from the balance.
4. Execute the functions by clicking the "transact" button to retrieve the updated balance.
